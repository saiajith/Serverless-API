# AWS Serverless-API
High-level overview and design

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/10a3538a-2e2c-4e76-b410-b0bd71593742)

An Amazon API Gateway serves as a bridge between clients and backend services, enabling users to expose AWS Lambda functions, HTTP endpoints, and other AWS services through RESTful and WebSocket APIs. Amazon API Gateway consists of a set of resources and corresponding methods that enable the creation, management, and execution of APIs.

In this setup, an API called DynamoDBManager is created with a POST method. This method is powered by a Lambda function named LambdaFunctionOverHttps, which is responsible for inserting data into a DynamoDB table called lambda-apigateway.

The POST method in the DynamoDBManager API supports the following DynamoDB operations:

‚úî Create an item üìù

‚úî Read an item üìñ

‚úî List all items üìã

Additionally, it includes built-in logging and monitoring through Amazon CloudWatch, ensuring better visibility and performance tracking.

The JSON request sent in the POST request specifies the desired operation and includes the relevant data needed for execution.

‚úÖ Suggestion: Use Postman, a third-party application, to send HTTP requests and interact with the DynamoDBManager API efficiently.

# SETUP
**Creating an IAM Role for Lambda Execution**

To allow your Lambda function to access AWS resources, you need to create an IAM execution role with the necessary permissions.

Steps to Create an Execution Role:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Open the IAM console and navigate to the Roles page.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Click on Create role.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Configure the role with the following properties:

**Trusted entity**: AWS Lambda

**Role name**: lambda-apigateway-role

**Permissions**: Attach a **custom policy** that grants access to **DynamoDB** for data operations and **CloudWatch Logs** for monitoring.

This role ensures that the Lambda function can securely write data to **DynamoDB** and log events to **CloudWatch**.

Below is a JSON for IAM policy:

    {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
    {
    "Sid": "Stmt1428341300017",
    "Action": [  
    "dynamodb:DeleteItem",
    "dynamodb:GetItem",
    "dynamodb:PutItem",
    "dynamodb:Query",
    "dynamodb:Scan",
    "dynamodb:UpdateItem"
    ],
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
    "Sid": "",
    "Resource": "*", 
    "Action": [ 
    "logs:CreateLogGroup",
    "logs:CreateLogStream",
    "logs:PutLogEvents"
    ], 
    "Effect": "Allow"
    }
    ]
    }

 **Create Lambda Function**

 Creating a New Lambda Function on AWS

Follow these steps to create a Lambda function from scratch:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Navigate to AWS Lambda

‚úÖ Your Lambda function is now created and ready for further configuration! üöÄ

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5f07dec9-e44e-490a-a4fb-c097927b50a6)

Click on the Lambda function and replace the boilerplate coding with below code

      from __future__ import print_function
      
      import boto3
      import json
      
      print('Loading function')
      
      
      def lambda_handler(event, context):
          '''Provide an event that contains the following keys:

          - operation: one of the operations in the operations dict below
          - tableName: required for operations that interact with DynamoDB
          - payload: a parameter to pass to the operation being performed
        '''
        #print("Received event: " + json.dumps(event, indent=2))
    
        operation = event['operation']
    
        if 'tableName' in event:
            dynamo = boto3.resource('dynamodb').Table(event['tableName'])
    
        operations = {
            'create': lambda x: dynamo.put_item(**x),
            'read': lambda x: dynamo.get_item(**x),
            'update': lambda x: dynamo.update_item(**x),
            'delete': lambda x: dynamo.delete_item(**x),
            'list': lambda x: dynamo.scan(**x),
            'echo': lambda x: x,
            'ping': lambda x: 'pong'
        }
    
        if operation in operations:
            return operations[operation](event.get('payload'))
        else:
            raise ValueError('Unrecognized operation "{}"'.format(operation))

**Testing Your Lambda Function (Echo Test)**

Before deploying, let's run a quick echo test to ensure the function is working correctly. Since we haven't set up API Gateway or DynamoDB yet, the function should simply return whatever input we provide.

Steps to Test the Lambda Function:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Open your Lambda function in the AWS Console.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Click on the "Test" tab.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Create a new test event by clicking "Create a new test event".

4Ô∏è‚É£ Paste the provided JSON into the event input field.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Click "Test" to execute the function.

    {
        "operation": "echo",
        "payload": {
            "somekey1": "somevalue1",
            "somekey2": "somevalue2"
        }
    }

Click "Save"

Adding a POST Method to the API Resource
Now that we have created a resource (e.g., /items) in API Gateway, let's add a POST method to integrate it with our Lambda function.

Steps to Add a POST Method:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Open the DynamoDBOperations API in the API Gateway Console.

2Ô∏è‚É£ In the left panel, select the newly created resource (e.g., /items).

3Ô∏è‚É£ Click "Create Method", and from the dropdown, select POST.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Configure the method:

Integration type: Select Lambda Function.

Lambda function name: Enter LambdaFunctionOverHttps (the function we created earlier).

5Ô∏è‚É£ Click "Create Method" to save the configuration.

‚úÖ POST method successfully created! This setup allows API Gateway to invoke the Lambda function, which will handle requests and interact with DynamoDB. üöÄ

Deploying the API to a Stage

Now that we have configured our DynamoDBOperations API, it‚Äôs time to deploy it to make it accessible.

Steps to Deploy the API:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Open the API Gateway Console and select your DynamoDBOperations API.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Click on the "Actions" dropdown.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Select "Deploy API".

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c137971f-ba7b-4424-8d21-04fbf16b5994)

4Ô∏è‚É£ In the Deployment Stage section:

Choose or Create a Stage: Select "New Stage".

Stage Name: Enter prod (short for production).

5Ô∏è‚É£ Click "Deploy" and copy the "Invoke URL" from screen

**Running our solution using Postman application**

The Lambda function supports using the create operation to create an item in your DynamoDB table. To request this operation, use the following JSON:

    {
        "operation": "create",
        "tableName": "lambda-apigateway",
        "payload": {
            "Item": {
                "id": "1234ABCD",
                "number": 5
            }
        }
    }

Postman is a powerful tool for API development and testing, making it easier to send requests, analyze responses, and manage API workflows. Follow these steps to test your deployed API using Postman.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Create a New Collection

Open Postman.

Click "New" ‚Üí "Collection".

Name it something meaningful, e.g., DynamoDBOperations API.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Add a New Request to the Collection

Click the three dots (...) next to the collection name.

Select "Add Request".

Name the request "Create Item" (or another relevant name).

3Ô∏è‚É£ Configure the API Request

In the request editor, select "POST" from the method dropdown.

Copy the "Invoke URL" from the PROD stage of API Gateway.

Paste the URL in the request URL field.

‚úÖ Your Postman request is now set up! üöÄ

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2428b361-3eef-4dea-a8f4-472eae6e3ab0)

To validate that the item is indeed inserted into DynamoDB table, go to Dynamo console, select "lambda-apigateway" table, select "Items" tab, and the newly inserted item should be displayed.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0029c838-c095-414c-b010-5ae7644d52a1)

To get all the inserted items from the table, we can use the "list" operation of Lambda using the same API. Pass the following JSON to the API, and it will return all the items from the Dynamo table

    {
        "operation": "list",
        "tableName": "lambda-apigateway",
        "payload": {
        }
    }


**Load Tesing & Measuring Performance**

Postman enables you to simulate user traffic and observe how your API behaved under load. It also helps to identify any issues or bottlenecks that affect performance.

**Configuration**

TImeout: 5 sec to 3 sec

Limit instances: 10

Memeory: 128MB to 1024MB
